**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage - The Day the Database Decided to Party! ðŸŽ‰**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: November 15, 2023, 14:30 UTC
  - End Time: November 16, 2023, 03:45 UTC
- **Impact:**
  - The web application threw a tantrum, leaving 30% of users locked out and the rest stuck in slow-motion chaos. It was like the Matrix, but with more confusion and fewer cool sunglasses.
- **Root Cause:**
  - Our database decided to host an unplanned party, inviting more connections than it could handle. The result? A digital mosh pit that crashed the system. Database, you wild thing!

**Timeline:**
- **Detection:**
  - November 15, 2023, 14:30 UTC
  - Our monitoring dashboard blinked like a disco ball with alarming error rates and latency metrics.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - First suspected a network hiccup, thinking our servers were having a midlife crisis.
  - Checked server logs, expecting to find a digital treasure hunt. Alas, it was just logs being logs.
  - Thought we were under DDoS attack, so we pulled out our virtual water guns and initiated DDoS mitigation measures.
  - Eventually called in the DevOps and Database teams, realizing we needed the IT SWAT team.

- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Initially accused load balancers of not doing their balancing act. Turns out, they were on break.
  - Rolled back changes like we were time travelers fixing historical blunders. Spoiler alert: It didn't work.
  - Briefly considered an alien invasion, but our firewalls are extraterrestrial-proof.

- **Escalation:**
  - Sent an SOS to the DevOps and Database teams, hoping they had the digital superhero capes handy.
  - Senior engineers and database wizards joined the virtual battlefield, ready to banish bugs and bring peace to the server realm.

- **Resolution:**
  - Unmasked the party-crasher: a surge in database connections.
  - Applied a temporary fix by manually expanding the connection pool - our database's VIP section.
  - Long-term solution involved optimizing database queries and introducing connection bouncers to keep the party under control.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:**
  - Database connections went wild, exceeding their RSVP limit. It was the digital version of too many guests at the door.

- **Resolution:**
  - Short-term fix: Gave the database some virtual aspirin by manually expanding the connection pool.
  - Long-term solution: Put the database on a diet, optimizing queries and introducing connection bouncers to keep the numbers in check.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements:**
  - Implemented a database fitness regime with enhanced monitoring to catch connection overindulgence early.
  - Strengthened communication channels between teams because even databases need therapy sessions.

- **Tasks:**
  - Taught our system to auto-scale the connection pool â€“ no more manual interventions!
  - Hosted a query intervention, making our database queries lean and fit.
  - Upgraded our DDoS detection, now capable of distinguishing between genuine spikes and malicious mayhem.
  - Scheduled a post-incident review, where we'll dissect the outage like a virtual coroner's report.

In the end, the database's wild party taught us to keep an eye on our digital friends and ensure they don't get too rowdy. Because when the database decides to dance, the whole system better be ready to tango! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º
